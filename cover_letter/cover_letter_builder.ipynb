You also don’t call out the specific tech (TypeScript, Python, cloud infrastructure) and startup skills (AI model exploration, customer interviews, tooling judgments) that the job posting highlights. 3) Voice: the language reads like a template — consider tightening it with more concrete examples (e.g. “I led a rapid AI-powered prototype in 48 hours to vet a new ad-tech concept”) and a stronger hook about why PSL’s mission excites you. To improve: merge your two experience paragraphs into one succinct body, open with a specific statement about PSL’s approach and your fit, and close with a clear call to action in a single final paragraph."

You also don’t call out the specific tech (TypeScript, Python, cloud infrastructure) and startup skills (AI model exploration, customer interviews, tooling judgments) that the job posting highlights. 3) Voice: the language reads like a template — consider tightening it with more concrete examples (e.g. “I led a rapid AI-powered prototype in 48 hours to vet a new ad-tech concept”) and a stronger hook about why PSL’s mission excites you.

A line on how you’d leverage your AWS or cloud-infrastructure background to set the technical foundation for new spinouts would reinforce fit.\n",
