The opening is polite but lacks a strong hook about why you specifically want to work at Stably—mentioning their stablecoin technology or blockchain mission would show you’ve done your research. Your body paragraph highlights relevant projects, but you should connect those experiences directly to the skills and responsibilities listed in the internship posting (e.g. emphasize any front-end frameworks or DevOps tools Stably uses). The closing is courteous but could include a clear call to action and reiterate your enthusiasm for this particular role. To improve, personalize the letter by referencing Stably’s products or culture, add an engaging story or outcome from your past work, and demonstrate exactly how your background will advance their goals."

       "While this cover letter is professional and follows a basic structure, it reads as formulaic and bears hallmarks of AI generation rather than a personalized message. Key areas for improvement:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Opening Paragraph Lacks Engagement\n",
       "   • You restate your degree and GPA but miss an opportunity to grab attention with a specific insight or story (e.g., a moment when you discovered blockchain’s potential).\n",
       "   • Try beginning with a brief anecdote or achievement that directly ties to Stably’s work in stablecoins.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Overly Generic Language and Structure\n",
       "   • Phrases like “keen on utilizing my software development skills” and “technical proficiency” are vague. Instead, name a concrete Stably product (for example, Stably USD) and describe how you would enhance it.\n",
       "   • The three‐paragraph framework is good, but each should feel distinct. Paragraph two mixes your team leadership and Army experience; break these into their own bullet points or sentences for clarity and impact.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Insufficient Tailoring to the Internship Role\n",
       "   • The letter mentions Docker and full‐stack work, but doesn’t connect to the Co-Op internship’s responsibilities (e.g., API integrations with blockchain networks or front-end data visualization for DeFi dashboards).\n",
       "   • Reference a project or coursework that directly used smart contracts, Web3 libraries, or cryptographic methods, since Stably focuses on blockchain.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Add Quantifiable Achievements and Personal Touches\n",
       "   • You mention leading a team and working under pressure in the Army, but give a brief metric or result (e.g., “trained 15 soldiers to exceed certification benchmarks by 20%”).\n",
       "   • Include one or two sentences about your personal motivation for financial inclusion through stablecoins—this strengthens cultural fit.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Tone and Authenticity\n",
       "   • Soften overly formal or robotic phrases. Write as yourself: use first‐person active verbs (“I built,” “I collaborated,” “I designed”).\n",
       "   • Proofread for small typos (e.g., ensure consistent tense and punctuation).\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, this draft needs stronger personalization, more detail on how your experiences map to Stably’s Co-Op responsibilities, and a more compelling opening. Rewriting with specific references to Stably’s products, quantifiable outcomes, and a story‐driven start will make your cover letter far more engaging and authentic."

       "1. Opening Paragraph Lacks Engagement\n",
       "   • You restate your degree and GPA but miss an opportunity to grab attention with a specific insight or story (e.g., a moment when you discovered blockchain’s potential).\n",
       "   • Try beginning with a brief anecdote or achievement that directly ties to Stably’s work in stablecoins.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Overly Generic Language and Structure\n",
       "   • Phrases like “keen on utilizing my software development skills” and “technical proficiency” are vague. Instead, name a concrete Stably product (for example, Stably USD) and describe how you would enhance it.\n",
       "   • The three‐paragraph framework is good, but each should feel distinct. Paragraph two mixes your team leadership and Army experience; break these into their own bullet points or sentences for clarity and impact.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Insufficient Tailoring to the Internship Role\n",
       "   • The letter mentions Docker and full‐stack work, but doesn’t connect to the Co-Op internship’s responsibilities (e.g., API integrations with blockchain networks or front-end data visualization for DeFi dashboards).\n",
       "   • Reference a project or coursework that directly used smart contracts, Web3 libraries, or cryptographic methods, since Stably focuses on blockchain.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Add Quantifiable Achievements and Personal Touches\n",
       "   • You mention leading a team and working under pressure in the Army, but give a brief metric or result (e.g., “trained 15 soldiers to exceed certification benchmarks by 20%”).\n",
       "   • Include one or two sentences about your personal motivation for financial inclusion through stablecoins—this strengthens cultural fit.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Tone and Authenticity\n",
       "   • Soften overly formal or robotic phrases. Write as yourself: use first‐person active verbs (“I built,” “I collaborated,” “I designed”).\n",
       "   • Proofread for small typos (e.g., ensure consistent tense and punctuation).\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, this draft needs stronger personalization, more detail on how your experiences map to Stably’s Co-Op responsibilities, and a more compelling opening. Rewriting with specific references to Stably’s products, quantifiable outcomes, and a story‐driven start will make your cover letter far more engaging and authentic.\n",

       "I am writing to express my interest in the Full Stack Engineer Co-Op Internship at Stably. As a recent graduate from the University of Washington, Tacoma, with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a 3.9 GPA, I am particularly drawn to Stably's pioneering work in blockchain and stablecoin technologies. My academic projects and experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in software development, and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Stably's mission of enhancing financial systems and promoting financial inclusion.\n",
       "\n",
       "During my academic career, I led a team to develop a comprehensive bookkeeping web app, employing a React/Next.js frontend and a Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL backend. This project honed my skills in API design, Docker containerization, and collaborative development. Notably, I successfully implemented a RESTful API and adapted to a new codebase, demonstrating flexibility and teamwork. Additionally, my role as a sergeant in the US Army Reserves has instilled in me strong leadership and communication skills, enabling me to thrive in dynamic environments, which aligns well with the responsibilities at Stably.\n",
       "\n",
       "Stably's commitment to technological innovation and financial inclusion through blockchain resonates deeply with my aspirations to create impactful solutions. I am particularly impressed by your work with stablecoins, such as Stably USD, and I am eager to apply my technical skills and dedication to contribute meaningfully to your groundbreaking projects. I look forward to the possibility of joining your mission-driven team and supporting Stably's efforts to transform financial systems.\n",

       "Thank you for considering my application.\n",

       "This cover letter reads as a polished but generic AI-generated response rather than a personalized message to Stably. While it follows a three-paragraph structure and mentions relevant projects and leadership experience, the opening is standard (“I am writing to express my interest...”), and the language is formulaic. To improve: \n",
       "\n",
       "1. Strengthen the opening with a specific hook – perhaps a brief anecdote or direct reference to Stably’s recent product launch or technical challenge that resonated with you. \n",
       "2. Inject your genuine voice and passion: explain why blockchain and stablecoins matter to you personally and how your background uniquely positions you to contribute. \n",
       "3. Tie your skills more directly to Stably’s advertised tech stack or responsibilities (e.g., mention familiarity with their CI/CD pipeline, smart contract languages, or specific frameworks). \n",
       "4. Close with an active next step (“I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in X and Y can help Stably accelerate its roadmap”).\n",
       "\n",
       "Personalizing these elements will make the letter more engaging, less templated, and clearly written by you rather than an AI.\n",
