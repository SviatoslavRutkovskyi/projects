      "## Summary:\n",
      "As a passionate and experienced software engineer based in New York City, I’ve spent over a decade building scalable, high-impact web applications that improve user experience and drive business results. After earning my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Pittsburgh, I began my career at MarketSmart, where I dove deep into API development and automation. Since 2015, I’ve been part of the engineering team at Embark, where I’ve helped lead the transformation of a legacy web application into a high-performing single-page app—contributing directly to a $1.4M annual revenue boost.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working closely with product managers, designers, and fellow engineers to build intuitive, responsive, and reliable systems. Whether I’m optimizing performance for 35M+ users, designing internal tools, or mentoring junior engineers, I bring a strong sense of ownership and a love for clean, maintainable code.\n",
      "\n",
      "My technical toolkit includes Python (Django), JavaScript (React, Node.js), SQL/NoSQL databases, and cloud infrastructure with AWS. I’m always looking to deepen my knowledge and stay sharp—recently, I even built a poker simulation app combining machine learning and real-time visualizations, just for fun.\n",
