Dear Hiring Manager,

As a seasoned software engineer with over a decade of experience building scalable, data-driven applications, I’m excited to apply for a software engineering position at Microsoft. The opportunity to contribute to a company known for its innovation and impact aligns perfectly with my passion for solving complex technical challenges at scale.

At Embark, where I’ve been part of the engineering team since 2015, I helped re-architect a multi-page application into a high-performing single-page app, directly boosting annual revenue by $1.4M. I’ve also built an ad-serving platform that scaled to 35 million users, increasing page speed by 15%. These projects were driven by my focus on thoughtful architecture, collaboration across teams, and clean, efficient code.

I bring to the table deep experience in Python (Django), JavaScript (React/Node), and cloud technologies like AWS, along with a strong foundation in databases and RESTful API design. I thrive in environments where I can iterate quickly, partner with cross-functional teams, and constantly improve systems to meet real-world needs—values I know Microsoft shares.

Outside of my professional work, I enjoy exploring projects that combine data science and web development, including a poker simulation app I built using Sci-Kit Learn and Cards.js. I’m always looking to grow and explore new tools, frameworks, and ways to make software more intuitive and impactful.

I would be thrilled to bring my experience, energy, and curiosity to Microsoft, and I welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your engineering team. Thank you for considering my application—I look forward to connecting soon.

Sincerely,
Charles McTurland
