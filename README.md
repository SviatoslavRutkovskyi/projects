# projects

SETUP:

Use uv to download nessesary packages, using command "uv sync".
If you don't have it installed, you can install it here: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

Create a .env file with a OpenAI API key, using the variable OPENAI_API_KEY.

This repo contains an about directory, which contains personal information that some projects may use to provide more context to AI. If you want to get the best results, replace the file contents with information relevant to you.

After doing that, you should be set up, and be able to use the projects.
